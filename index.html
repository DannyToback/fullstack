	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p>I am a senior at Bucknell University actively seeking to apply my skills to a full-time position in the near future. My first true love in Computer Science was Software Development in Java, though this whole Web-Development thing is pretty fun. I took full advantage of my liberal arts education by earning minors in both Economics and Spanish. An obligatory fun fact about me is that I was the Drum Captain of my State Champion marching band. While born and raised in sunny Long Island, I hope to make my next big step by moving to The Big City (Manhattan).</p>
